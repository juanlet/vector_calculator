# Array Calculator

The Array Calculator is a simple command-line tool that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations on arrays or matrices. It utilizes the NumPy library for efficient array operations in Python.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the Git repository or download the source code files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage

To use the Array Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Run the script by executing `python array_calculator.py`.
2. The program will display a welcome message and provide instructions.
3. Enter the arrays or matrices as prompted, using the appropriate format. For example, `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`.
4. Specify the arithmetic operation you want to perform (+, -, *, /).
5. The program will check the dimensions of the arrays/matrices. If they match, it will display the result of the operation. If not, an error message will be shown.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of valid inputs:

- Array 1: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
  Array 2: [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]
  Operation: +

- Array 1: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
  Array 2: [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
  Operation: *
